# Real-Time-Weather-Forecasting-App

Type - 
Application Development, Programming, Web development

Objective(s) -
To develop a web-based weather application that provides real-time weather information of a location, such as Current temperature, and Chances of precipitation. Also, it tells if it is going to be a sunny, cloudy, or rainy day ahead.

Need - 
To develop a weather application, all you need is the basic knowledge of the trifecta of web development, i.e., HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For creating a proper back-end of the app server in JavaScript, you will have to get familiar with Node.js and Express technologies.

It would be best to learn how to use API calls to get weather data from another website (like weatherstack.com) and display selective data right inside your webapp.

For the weather applicationâ€™s UI, you need to conjure an input text box where users can enter the name of a location for which they wish to check the weather. As soon as the user hits the search button - most likely to be adjacent to the text box, but you are free to get creative as per your liking - the weather forecast for the entered location should be displayed.
